Budget management webapp. Works PHP-based, using PHP in backend and javascript in frontend. Programmed ~2011 to enhance my PHP skill up-to-date with OOP PHP.

The software was never fully completed, but works. Is not the prettiest possible, lacks features and requires some labour work inputting receipts when used.
